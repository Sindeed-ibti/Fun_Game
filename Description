# Well This game is a beginner kinda project of mine.
Rules:
1. 7 indicates the current position of the player.
2. 10 is the position of the treasure . If you can reach the position 10 without stepping on a mine then you'll win. mines are indicated with -1 .
3. Type Up to go up and Type Down to go down .
4. Type Left to go left and Type Right to go right.

Pretty easy !!Right??
